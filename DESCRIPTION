Description: A general spatiotemporal satellite image imputation method based on sparse 
functional data analytic techniques. The imputation method applies and extends the Functional 
Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE). The underlying idea for the proposed 
procedure is to impute a missing pixel by borrowing information from temporally and spatially
contiguous pixels based on the best linear unbiased prediction.
